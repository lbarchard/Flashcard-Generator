# Flashcard-Generator
This program will generate and store two type of flashcards.  All data is ultimately saved in a MYSQL database and added and selected using RESTful endpoints.

Use Flash_Card_DB.SQL to create the initial database.  It will also seed the database with one Cloze and one Basic flashcard.

Use Flash_Cards_Collection.json to import a REST collection into Postman.

There is no UI besides Postman.  Waiting on UI/UX team and front end team to get their job done.

index.js is the starting file to start the Node project.  Also if actually trying to run this go to the index file and enter your specific database connection information including your password.
